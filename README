In order to use the CoScale plugin for Chef next steps should be followed:
1. The content of the recipes/default.rb should be added in the recipe that will create the event;
2. The parameters of the Chef::Coscale.event() function should be changed with the client parameters;
3. The file libraries/coscale.rb should be added in the cookbook libraries directory.
